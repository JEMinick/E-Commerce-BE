## Description: 

The primary motivation for creating E-Commerce-BE was to create a back-end API that will provide an interface which provides information and updates for a real-time inventory database in order for me to mananage my new e-commerce portal..
The problem being addressed and resolved with this app is to provide a real-time inventory for my new e-commerce web site.
By creating this app, I learned the following: Sequelize and establishing a many-to-many relationship within a relational database.
